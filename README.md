Embedding strand spaces in Coq and working to verify correctness and other properties.


Requires Coq v8.4pl2

Based on work from the following publications:

FÃ¡brega, F. Javier Thayer, Jonathan C. Herzog, and Joshua D. Guttman. 
  "Strand spaces: Proving security protocols correct."

File Descriptions
=================
CoLoR*.v
- These files are from the CoLoR library (http://color.inria.fr/) - this was used for proofs of the decidability of the transitive closure of a decidable relation, if limited to a finite set. Files were included in this repo so a person cloning this project need not install any other libraries in order to build the project.

strictorder.v
- This file focuses on the proofs which show for any finite set and strict order there exists a minimal element under said order. This is used in strandspace.v for the minimal member Lemma, since the "less than" relation in a Bundle which is derived from the union and transitive closure of Comm and Successor edges is a strict order.

util.v
- This just contains some convenient notation I feel clarifies work in proofs (the "Case", "SCase" notation, mainly).
