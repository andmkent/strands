These are files extracted from the CoLor Coq library on rewriting
and termination. For more info, Check http://color.inria.fr/

The only modifications have been to RelDec.v, where Variable 
"Variable A : Set." was changed to "Variable A : Type."

The documentation for this file indicated it should "Type,"
it is unclear if the documentation or code was incorrect.
Regardless... the change to "Type" was made for this
limited subset of the library.
