Terms (alphabetical):

_BUNDLE_
- a portion of a strand space, consisting of strands connected where
  one strand tx and another strand rx that same msg. 
  (pg 4 "Strand Spaces: Proving...")
- is large enough to represent at least a full protocol exchange
  (pg 5 "Strand Spaces: Proving...")
- has a natural causal precedence relation relative to which inductive
  arguments may be carried out (pg 5 "Strand Spaces: Proving...")
- A finite subgraph of the graph (N, (-> U =>)) where the edges express
  causal dependencies of the nodes.
- Definition (Def 2.4 pg 7 "Strand Spaces: Proving...")
-- C = (Nc, (->c U =>c)), which is a subgraph of (N, (-> U =>)) is
   a bundle if:
--- C is finite
--- if n2 in Nc and term(n2) is negative, there is a unique n1 s.t.
    n1 ->c n2
--- If n2 in Nc and n1 => n2 then n1 =>c n2
--- C is acyclic

_CORRECTNESS_
- typically, to be correct, each bundle in a strand space must contain one strand
  for each legitamite principal participating in the session. Other strands (legit or not)
  may be entangled as long as they do not prevent correctness


_FRESHNESS_
- A strand spaces models the assumption that some values occur only freshly
  by including only one strand originating that data item by initially sending
  a message containing it

_PENETRATOR STRAND_
- sequence of message tx and rx events that model the capability a
  penetrator should be assumed to possess.
  (pg 4 "Strand Spaces: Proving...")
- Often the space models the fact that some values are impossible for the penetrator to guess


_PRINCIPAL_
- 


_STRAND_
- sequence of events that a single principal may engage in 
  (pg 3 "Strand Spaces: Proving...")
- sequence of message tx and rx, with specific values of all data, such as keys and nonces
  (pg 3 "Strand Spaces: Proving...")
- represents (for a legitimate principal) the actions of that party in one particular run
  of the protocol.
  (pg 4 "Strand Spaces: Proving...")
- a linear structure, a sequence of one principal's message tx and rxs.
  (pg 5 "Strand Spaces: Proving...")

_STRAND SPACE_
- A set of strands (both legitimate and penetrator)
  (pg 3 & 4 "Strand Spaces: Proving...")
- A Strand Space over a set of terms A is a set E together with a trace mapping
  tr: E -> (+/-A)*.
  (pg 6 "Strand Spaces: Proving...")
- Formal Definition (Def 2.3 pg 6 "Strand Spaces: Proving..."):
-- A _NODE_ is a pair [s, i] where s from E and i s.t. 1 <= 1 <= len(tr(s)),
    and N is the set of all nodes
-- Node [s, i] belongs to strand s
-- every node belongs to a unique strand
-- if n = [s, i] from N then:
--- index(n) = i
--- strand(n) = s
--- term(n) = tr(s)[i] (i.e. the ith signed term in the trace of s)
--- uns_term(n) = tr(s)[i][2] (i.e. the unsigned ith term in trace)
-- an _EDGE_ n -> m exists iff term(n) = +a and term(nm) = -a for
   some a in A - thus showing a potential causal link between those
   strands
-- an _EDGE_ n1 => n2 when n1 = [s, i] and n2 = [s, i + 1], expressing
   n1 is the immediate causal predecessor of n2 on strand s.
-- n' =>+ n means n' precedes n (at some point) on the same strand
-- An unsigned term t occurs in n from N iff t is a subterm of term(n)
-- Suppose I is a set of unsigned terms, then node n from N is an _ENTRY POINT_
   for I iff term(n) = +t for some t in I, and whenever n' =>+ n, 
   term(n') is not in I.
-- An unsigned term t originates on n from N iff n is an entry point for the
   set I = {t' : t subterm of t'}
-- An unsigned term t is uniquely originating iff t originates on a unique n in N.
-- N (set of nodes) combined w/ sets of edges (-> and =>) is a directed graph
   (N, (-> U =>))
   



_TERM_
- possible message that can be exchanged between principals in a protocol
  (pg 5 "Strand Spaces: Proving...")
- a subterm relation can exist between different terms
  (pg 5 "Strand Spaces: Proving...")
- any term a in the set of all terms A can be annotated as (+, a) or
  (-, a) representing the term a tx'd or rx'd
  (pg 6 "Strand Spaces: Proving...")

_TRANSMISSION_
- a strand (process) may tx or rx a msg, but not both simultaneously
- when a strand receives msg m, there is a unique node transmitting
  m from which the msg was immediately rx'd
- when msg m is tx'd, many strands my immediately rx m
