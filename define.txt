Terms (alphabetical):

_BUNDLE_
- a portion of a strand space, consisting of strands connected where
  one strand tx and another strand rx that same msg. 
  (pg 4 "Strand Spaces: Proving...")
- is large enough to represent at least a full protocol exchange
  (pg 5 "Strand Spaces: Proving...")
- has a natural causal precedence relation relative to which inductive
  arguments may be carried out (pg 5 "Strand Spaces: Proving...")

_CORRECTNESS_
- typically, to be correct, each bundle in a strand space must contain one strand
  for each legitamite principal participating in the session. Other strands (legit or not)
  may be entangled as long as they do not prevent correctness


_FRESHNESS_
- A strand spaces models the assumption that some values occur only freshly
  by including only one strand originating that data item by initially sending
  a message containing it

_PENETRATOR STRAND_
- sequence of message tx and rx events that model the capability a
  penetrator should be assumed to possess.
  (pg 4 "Strand Spaces: Proving...")
- Often the space models the fact that some values are impossible for the penetrator to guess


_PRINCIPAL_
- 


_STRAND_
- sequence of events that a single principal may engage in 
  (pg 3 "Strand Spaces: Proving...")
- sequence of message tx and rx, with specific values of all data, such as keys and nonces
  (pg 3 "Strand Spaces: Proving...")
- represents (for a legitimate principal) the actions of that party in one particular run
  of the protocol.
  (pg 4 "Strand Spaces: Proving...")
- a linear structure, a sequence of one principal's message tx and rxs.
  (pg 5 "Strand Spaces: Proving...")

_STRAND SPACE_
- A set of strands (both legitimate and penetrator)
  (pg 3 & 4 "Strand Spaces: Proving...")
