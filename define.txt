_BUNDLE_
- A bundle is a portion of a strand space - a number of strands 
hooked together where one strand sends a message and another 
strand receives that same message.


_CORRECTNESS_
- Typically, for a protocol to be correct, each such bundle must 
contain one strand for each of the legitimate principals apparently
participating in this session, all agreeing on the principals,
nonces, and session keys [15, 26, 32]. (Penetrator strands or stray
legit strands may be tangled in the bundle, but do not compromise
data/secrecy etc...)
- Protocol correctness typically depends essentially on the freshness of 
data items such as nonces and session keys. For this reason, the strand 
spaces that concern us are not full, in the sense that they do not contain 
all the strands that would arise if all possible data items were used.
the space models the assumption that some values occur only freshly by including 
only one strand *originating* that data item by initially sending a 
message containing it

_PRINCIPAL_


_STRAND_
- Sequence of events (representing execution/actions)
- A strand is a linear structure, a sequence of one principalâ€™s message 
transmissions and receptions. A bundle is a graph-structured entity, 
representing the communication among a number of strands.
Composed of:
Principal (whose strand it is)
sequence of TX/RX events
Other important details
There is a notion of what strand/nodes these TX/RX events are linked to?


_STRAND SPACE_
-Strand Space := Set of Strands (honest and dishonest)



Also, model some values are *impossible to guess* by penetrators.
