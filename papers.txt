*** SUBJECT(S) ***
Strand Spaces (How to prove a security protocol is correct)

*** KEYWORDS ***
_STRAND SPACES_ _CORRECTNESS_

*** TOPIC ***
*Q:What specific problem is this article addressing?
Explains a method of representing security protocols where their correctness
can be more accurately stated and proven than previous methods.

*Q:Why is it important?
Security protocols are essential and historically have been developed in an as needed
manner, but even when done carefully by experts these protocols often include
flaws that turn out to be detrimental to their effectiveness. 
Thus clearly a more simple, straightforward method to reason about these  protocols 
which allows more substantial reasoning and proofs about their correctness
is required.

*** FINDINGS ***
Q:What are the specific findings? 



*Q:How are they unique/new/unusual or supportive of other important work?
This method:
- Gives clear semantics to assumptions, such as freshness and uniqueness of items
- utilizes an explicit model of the possible behaviors of penetrators
- allows numerous notions of correctness to be proven (secrecy, authentication)
- gives detailed insight into reasons why protocol is correct and the involved
  assumptions.


*** RELEVANCE ***
*Q: How does this relate to or affect my work?
